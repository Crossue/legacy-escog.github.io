	The CFMIP2 GCM experiments were coordinated as part of the <a href="https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/esgf-llnl/">CMIP5 project</a>.</p>
<p>
	The CFMIP experiments are described in Section IV of the <a href="/site_media/projects/cfmip/CFMIP2_experiments_March20th2009.pdf">CFMIP-2 experimental design</a> and appear in Table 6 of the <a href="https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/">CMIP5 experimental design</a>.</p>
<p>
	An overview of the CFMIP model output requirements appears in Section III of the <a href="/site_media/projects/cfmip/CFMIP2_experiments_March20th2009.pdf">CFMIP-2 experimental design</a> and details are available in the CMIP5 List of Required Model Output (Please note that a list of which diagnostics are required in which experiments appears in &#39;CFMIP output&#39;, the penultimate worksheet in the document which is easily overlooked.)</p>

<p>
	The <a href="/site_media/projects/cfmip/pointlocations.txt">list of locations for high frequency CFMIP outputs</a> and <a href="/site_media/projects/cfmip/pointlocations.pdf">plot</a> is also now available.</p>
<p>
	- Updated with one additional Antarctic point to give a total of 119 - April 2010.</p>

<p>
	<a href="http://cfmip.metoffice.com/cfmip2_4k_patterned_sst_forcing.vn1.0.nc">A patterned SST forcing dataset</a> is required for experiment 6.6. This is a normalised multi-model ensemble mean of the ocean surface temperature response pattern (the change in ocean surface temperature (TOS) between years 0-20 and 140-160, the time of CO2 quadrupling in the 1% runs) from thirteen CMIP3 AOGCMs (cccma, cnrm, gfdlcm20, gfdlcm21, gisser, inmcm3, ipsl, miroc-medres, miub, mpi, mri, ncar-ccsm3, and ncar-pcm1.) Before computing the multi-model ensemble mean, each model&#39;s TOS response was divided by its global mean and multiplied by 4. This guarantees that the pattern information from all models is weighted equally and the global mean SST forcing is the same as in the uniform +4K experiment (6.8 in the CMIP5 expt. design document). (Thanks to Brian Soden for producing this).</p>

<p>
	Please note that CFMIP SST perturbation experiments (6.5, 6.6, 6.8) do not perturb sea ice, which should be kept at control values, as for experiment 3.3.</p>
