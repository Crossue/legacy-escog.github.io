				<p>
					We regret to announce the cancellation of the 2020 CFMIP meeting scheduled in September 2020 in Seattle USA<br />
					due to the coronavirus pandemic. This decision has been taken by the CFMIP SSC and local organizers as many in<br />
					CFMIP friends and colleagues have expressed concern and their health and safety is our foremost priority.<br />
					It is so disappointing not to have the in person meeting in this September, but we will re-arrange the CFMIP meeting<br />

					<b>CFMIP/GCSS/EUCLIPSE Meeting on Cloud Processes and Climate Feedbacks<br />

				A joint meeting between CFMIP, <a href="http://appconv.metoffice.com/blclouds/">GCSS</a> and <a href="http://www.euclipse.eu/">EUCLIPSE</a> was held in Exeter during the week of 6th-10th June, 2011. The theme of the meeting was understanding, evaluating and improving the representation of cloud processes and cloud feedbacks in global models. There was a particular emphasis on presentation and discussion of results and/or analysis plans related to CFMIP, EUCLIPSE and GCSS Boundary Layer Cloud cases (the <a href="http://atmgcm.msrc.sunysb.edu/cfmip_figs/Case_specification.html">CGILS</a> cloud feedback case and the <a href="http://www.euclipse.nl/wp3/ASTEX_Lagrangian/Introduction.shtml">ASTEX</a> and <a href="http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/mitarbeiter/irina-sandu/transition-cases.html">composite</a> stratocumulus to cumulus transition cases).

				<h3>
					<b>CGILS Meeting</b></h3>
				<h4>
					<b>(CFMIP-GCSS Intercomparison of Large-Eddy and Single-Column Models)</b></h4>
				<h4>
					<b>March 1-2, 2010 at Stony Brook, Long Island, New York <a href="http://www.somas.stonybrook.edu/cgils">(Meeting website)</a></b></h4>
				<p>
					The objective of this meeting is to understand the physical mechanism of cloud feedbacks in climate models that participate in the <a href="http://atmgcm.msrc.sunysb.edu/cfmip_figs/Case_specification.html"> CGILS case study </a> with the goal of interpreting climate sensitivities of AR5 models. Specifically, the meeting will focus on</p>
				<p>
					(1) how the parameterized processes (PBL, stratiform, convective, radiative) behave and interact to produce clouds in the SCMs</p>
				<p>
					(2) what are the physical mechanisms of cloud feedback in the individual SCMs</p>
				<p>
					(3) what can be learned from the LESs</p>
				<p>
					(4) how can the LES results be used to constrain SCMs</p>
				<p>
					(5) how to extrapolate the CGILS results to cloud feedbacks and climate sensitivities of the GCMs</p>
				<p>
					Each participating group has been invited to make presentations for an in-depth analysis of its CGILS results. The presentations will cover all three CGILS locations (shallow cumulus, stratocumulus and stratus, at locations s6, s11, s12) , although emphasis will be for location s11 where LES results are available.</p>
				<p>
					The meeting is open to public, but only presentations related to the meeting objectives are invited. If you do not belong to a participating group and wish to make a presentation, please send an email to Minghua Zhang (mzhang@notes.cc.sunysb.edu).</p>

					<b>AMS Symposium on Boundary Layers and Turbulence</b></h3>
				<h4>
					<b>Keystone, Colorado, 2-6 August 2010</b></h4>
				<p>
					&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
					As chair of the AMS Committee on Boundary Layers and Turbulence, I want to invite you to the next Symposium. It will be held 2-6 August 2010 in Keystone, Colorado. We specifically hope to have a substantial number of submissions on boundary layer clouds, which is called out as a topic for emphasis in the Call for Papers. The conference web site is <a href="http://www.ametsoc.org/meet/fainst/201029agforest19blt9urban.html">here</a></p>
				<p>
					Basic information is on the site now, more will be added in the next few days. Keystone is in Summit County, a beautiful resort area in the Rocky Mountains, and about a 2-hour drive from Denver and Boulder.</p>
				<p>
					The Symposium is always a very intense and valuable meeting with high information density. We hope you will help to maintain that tradition by presenting your work on boundary layer clouds and related matters.</p>
				<p>
					If you have any questions, please contact me or Branko Kosovic, the Program Chair.</p>
