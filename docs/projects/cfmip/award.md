	For the purpose of encouranging research activity by young&nbsp;reserchers in CFMIP, we&nbsp;manage&nbsp;the CFMIP ECS award, which is given to the best two presentations&nbsp;by early career scientists who are either students or received their Ph.D. in the past five years. The award was started in 2017, partly supported by Nature Publishing Group (Nature Climate Change for 2017 and Nature Reviews Earth &amp; Environment for 2019). We ask participants of the CFMIP meeting&nbsp;every year to declare if they are eligible for nomination, and the selection of winners is taken place through a fair judgement by the steering committee. CFMIP strongly recommends young researchers to attend the meeting and try to get win!</p>
