 CFMIP is a WCRP endorsed project which aims to improve the 
understanding and evaluation of clouds, cloud feedbacks and changes 
regional-scale circulation and precipitation.</p>
<p>
	CFMIP started in 2003 and its first phase (CFMIP-1) organised an 
intercomparison based on perpetual July SST forced Cess style +2K 
experiments and 2xCO2 equilibrium mixed-layer model experiments 
containing ISCCP simulator in parallel with CMIP3 (McAvaney and Le 
Treut, 2003). Results from CFMIP-1 had a substantial impact on the 
evaluation of clouds in models and in the identification of low level 
cloud feedbacks as the primary cause of inter-model spread in cloud 
feedback, and featured prominently in the fourth and fifth IPCC 
assessments.</p>
<p>
	The subsequent objective of CFMIP-2 was to inform improved assessments 
of climate change cloud feedbacks by providing better tools to support 
evaluation of clouds simulated by climate models and to understand 
cloud-climate feedback processes. CFMIP-2 organized further experiments 
as part of CMIP5, introducing seasonally varying SST perturbation 
experiments for the first time, as well as fixed SST CO2 forcing 
experiments to examine cloud adjustments, and idealized ‘aquaplanet’ 
experiments to establish the contributions of land and zonally 
asymmetric circulations to cloud feedback uncertainties (Bony et al., 
2011). CFMIP-2 also introduced satellite simulators to CMIP via the 
CFMIP Observation Simulator Package (COSP), not only the ISCCP 
simulator, but additional simulators to facilitate the quantitative 
evaluation clouds using a new generation of active RADARs and LIDARs in 
space. Additionally CFMIP-2 introduced into CMIP5 process diagnostics 
such as temperature and humidity budget tendency terms and high 
frequency ‘cfSites’ outputs at 120 locations around the globe. CFMIP 
also organized a joint project with the GEWEX Global Atmospheric System 
Study (GASS) called CGILS (the CFMIP-GASS Intercomparison of LES and 
SCMs) to develop cloud feedback intercomparison cases to assess the 
physical credibility of cloud feedbacks in climate models by comparing 
Single Column Models (SCM) versions of GCMs with high resolution Large 
Eddy Simulations (LES) models. Additionally CFMIP-2 developed the 
CFMIP-OBS data portal and the CFMIP diagnostic codes repository.</p>
<p>
	Early studies arising from CFMIP-2 include numerous model evaluation 
studies using COSP, studies attributing cloud feedbacks and cloud 
adjustments to different cloud types, and the finding that idealized 
‘aquaplanet’ experiments without land or Walker circulations are able to
 capture the essential differences between models’ global cloud 
feedbacks and cloud adjustments. Process outputs from CFMIP have also 
been used to develop and test physical mechanisms proposed to explain 
and constrain inter-model spread in cloud feedbacks in the CMIP5 models.
 CGILS has demonstrated a consensus in the responses of LES models to 
climate forcings and identified a number of shortcomings in the physical
 representations of cloud feedbacks in climate models. Additionally the 
CFMIP experiments have, due to their idealized nature, proven useful in a
 number of studies not directly related to clouds, but instead analyzing
 the responses of regional precipitation and circulation patterns to CO2
 forcing and climate change. Studies using CFMIP-2 outputs from CMIP5 
remain ongoing and many further results are expected to feed into future
 assessments of the representation of clouds and cloud feedbacks in 
climate models. For a list of publications arising from CFMIP-2, please 
refer to the CFMIP publications page.</p>
<p>
	In 2015, CFMIP proposed a new set of coordinated experiments for CMIP6,
 and was subsequently endorsed as a CMIP6 project. For more details,
