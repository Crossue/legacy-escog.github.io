		<b>CFMIP2020 physical meeting cancelled due to COVID-19</b>
		<p>
			We regret to announce the cancellation of the CFMIP physical meeting in scheduled in September 2020 in Seattle USA due to the coronavirus pandemic. This decision has been taken by the CFMIP SSC and local organizers as many in CFMIP friends and colleagues have expressed concern and their health and safety is our foremost priority. It is so disappointing not to have the in person meeting in this September, but we will re-arrange the CFMIP meeting in Seattle sometime in 2021. Contingent upon the dates of the 2021 meeting are decided, we will make an announcement. <em>posted by Masa Watanabe, April 25th, 2020 </em></p>
