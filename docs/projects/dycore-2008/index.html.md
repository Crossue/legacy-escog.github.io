	A NCAR Advanced Studies Program (ASP) summer colloquium entitled Numerical Techniques for Global Atmospheric Models was held in Boulder on une 2-13, 2008. The primary organizers were: Peter H. Lauritzen (CGD, NCAR), Christiane Jablonowski (University of Michigan), Mark Taylor (Sandia National Laboratories) and Ramachandran D. Nair (IMAGe, NCAR).&nbsp; This site contains information that was used and generated at that colloquium.</p>

	<em>Output of nine models running test case 5-0-0 (Mountain-induced Rossby wave): 700 hPa zonal wind at day 15. The test starts with balanced and isothermal initial conditions. A 2-km-high Gaussian-hill-shaped mountain is placed at [90degE, 30degN] (not shown) to trigger Rossby waves. The test evaluates the treatment of the orography and reveals numerical noise (especially at later days).</em> [Image courtesy of Christiane Jablonowski.]</p>
