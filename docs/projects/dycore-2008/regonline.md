        <p>The reg-online system will allow us to receive application materials from prospective students. It produces custom reports that can be exported to excel spreadsheet format to assist in selection of attendees. It can also help the ASP office track speakers travel needs if we incorporate them into the process.</p>
<p>We will invite graduate students with backgrounds in atmospheric science, mathematics, computer science or other relevant disciplines to the summer colloquium.<br /> The following pieces of information will be requested from the applicants, (not necessarily in this order)</p>
