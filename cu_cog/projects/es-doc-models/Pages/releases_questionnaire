			</td>
			<td style="vertical-align: top;">
				<p>
					Key features of this release include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Support the CIM2 concept of document &quot;labels.&quot;</li>
					<li>
						Added the ability to uniquely identify documents based on arbitrary field values passed in as URL parameters.</li>
					<li>
						When a property is customized not to display it is immediately indicated by greying out that properties title in the customizer form.</li>
					<li>
						Added paging capability to the project pages.</li>
					<li>
						Added support for CIM2 documents with hiearchical sub-components; that is relationship properites that should be rendered using a treeview widget rather than as subforms or references.</li>
					<li>
						Added support for references by providing a widget to make a call to the ES-DOC Archive and find published documents of the correct type to reference.</li>
					<li>
						Hard-coded the rules that determine which relationships ought to be rendered as subforms and which ought to be rendered as references.</li>
					<li>
						Consoloidated the code for registering schemas and specializations, since both of those documents use the exact same underlying format.</li>
					<li>
						Added &quot;forgot password&quot; and &quot;forgot login&quot; functionality to the Questionnaire.</li>
					<li>
						Require users to provide an email address upon resistration.</li>
					<li>
						Allow project administrators to approve or deny project join requests.</li>
					<li>
						Hide the concept of distinct ontologies from the project page since this is confusing; Instead all supported document types are shown in a single list.</li>
					<li>
						The multiselect widget can be expanded even in &quot;read only&quot; mode.</li>
					<li>
						Create an initial Questionnaire Users Manual.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Known issues fixed in this release:</p>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Enumeration properties displayed in &quot;view&quot; mode in the Editor cannot be expanded to reveal potential enumeration choices.</li>

			<td style="vertical-align: top;">
				<p>
					Known issues carried over:</p>
				<ul>

						The Questionnaire generates errors in Internet Explorer that make the software unusable.</li>
					<li>
						The CIM Questionnaire does not yet have full test coverage.&nbsp; In particular, testing how the full range of customizations propagate through the CIM Editing Forms is not tested.</li>

						Both project members and project administrators can now create new documents.</li>
					<li>
						Selecting &quot;OTHER&quot; in an enumeration now consistently exposes a textbox for users to enter their other value.</li>
					<li>
						Correctly hides the &quot;join project&quot; button for current project members.</li>

						Added support for the creation, editing, and publishing of simple CIM2 documents. A simple document is one without a nested hierarchy (e.g. Responsible Party).</li>
					<li dir="ltr">
						Added the ability to make properties &quot;nillable&quot;. A property can be marked as &ldquo;nillable&rdquo; when no valid value is available (e.g. it is missing or inapplicable). This is required for CMIP6 because not all CIM properties will be applicable to every modelling group.</li>
					<li dir="ltr">
						Modified relationship properties so that they can point to different types of CIM entities (e.g. classes). For example, an Experiment may point to several Requirements - each of which is a different class (e.g. a forcing, a temporal constraint, or a geographic restraint). This supports a structural change introduced in CIM2.</li>
					<li dir="ltr">
						Added the ability to display information associated with individual enumeration choices. This will make providing information to CMIP6 more clear since many of the expected scientific properties are complex and require further explanation.</li>
					<li dir="ltr">
						Implemented a RESTful framework for the Editor. Now JSON serializations are used on the back-end and a consistent JavaScript framework is used on the front-end to render the forms. This improves the performance as well as making the code easier to maintain than the previous code which relied heavily on custom Django forms and formsets.</li>
					<li dir="ltr">
						Improved the look-and-feel of read-only fields in the Editor, to make things more legible.</li>
					<li dir="ltr">
						Improved overall system performance by preventing user interaction while AJAX calls are in-progress.</li>
					<li dir="ltr">
						Improved the error handling for invalid requests of published documents.</li>
				</ul>
				Known issues fixed in this release:
				<ul>
					<li>
						The Editor incorrectly assumes that all subforms have changed and therefore attempts to save all rendered subforms, even those with no content. Saving is now handled using RESTful techniques.</li>

					Key features of this release include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Implemented a RESTful framework for the Customizer. Now JSON serializations are used on the back-end and a consistent JavaScript framework is used on the front-end to render the forms. This improves the performance as well as making the code easier to maintain than the previous code which relied heavily on Django forms and formsets.</li>
					<li>
						Changed the way subform customizations are handled. Now, the entire set of subform customizations is created with default values when first loading the Customizer. This means that it is no longer necessary to tediously customize the behavior of each subform before being able to use them in the Editor. &nbsp;</li>
					<li>
						Improved the look-and-feel of the Project Page.&nbsp; The tables are now sortable by column and an additional &ldquo;last modified&rdquo; column has been added.&nbsp; Additionally, informative messages have been added in case no customizations or no documents exist.&nbsp; Finally, the buttons for viewing, editing, or customizing instances now open new browser tabs.</li>
					<li>
						Prevented users from customizing whether or not a subform is used. Subforms will now always be used for CIM Elements and will never be used for CIM Documents.&nbsp; The checkboxes and buttons that control this behavior have been disabled as needed.</li>
					<li>
						Added a &ldquo;honeypot&rdquo; field to the user registration page to prevent bogus user registrations.<br />
						Upgraded Django from version 1.6 to 1.8 (this is the latest supported version).</li>
					<li>
						Removed the ability to add or delete scientific category customizations.&nbsp; Such changes are more properly handled within the Controlled Vocabularies themselves.</li>
					<li>
						Ensured that the keys used to uniquely identify category customizations are not based on their names (which can potentially be changed in the Customizer).</li>
					<li>
						Fixed a bug in the display of categories. Previously, changes to the order of categories were not retained in the Customizer.</li>
					<li>
						Fixed a bug in the rendering of the customization URL.&nbsp; Now, after saving a customization with a new name, the browser is correctly redirected to a URL that includes that new name.&nbsp; Previously, although the content was correct, the URL still reflected the original name of the customization.</li>
					<li>
						Added a &ldquo;field type&rdquo; column to the list of scientific property customizations to better help organize them.</li>
					<li>
						Refactored the &ldquo;join a project&rdquo; function. Excess code has been removed and an appropriate error message in the event a join request fails has been added.&nbsp; Additionally, if a join request is pending an administrator&#39;s approval, a message is displayed if the user tries to join the project again.</li>
					<li>
						Standardized the look-and-feel of the accordion headers used in subforms to be the same as those used in the main forms.&nbsp; Previously, the headers in the subforms were too large, which forced some of their text to wrap inappropriately.</li>
					<li>
						Fixed a bug that caused URL parameters to sometimes be lost when redirecting to another page (e.g. when logging in or logging out).</li>
					<li>
						Forced password changing to now take place on its own page. This makes the process cleaner and easier to understand.<br />

				26 Aug 2015</td>
			<td>
				<p>
					Key features of this release include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Changed how CIM elements are entered. A CIM element is an internal structure that is <em>not</em> exported as a stand alone document. Previously, these elements could be shared across a project. This is no longer allowed. Instead each element will be created in its own &ldquo;subform&rdquo;, which is embedded within the main Questionnaire. While this may result in the occasional duplicated element, it does prevent editing one document from overriding the content of another.</li>
					<li>
						Added the ability to link to other published CIM documents via their URL. Model documentation often comes in a set of published documents such as Grids, Experiments, Simulations etc, which need to be interconnected. This is now possible.</li>
					<li>
						Ensured that properties which the CIM defines as &ldquo;required&rdquo; cannot be customized to be either optional or invisible.&nbsp; This prevents the publication of a document that appears to be complete and therefore publishable when, in fact, it is missing key required elements.</li>
					<li>
						Added customizable help text to Scientific Property Categories. This text can assist the user in filling out the Questionnaire.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Known issues fixed in this release:</p>

					<li>
						Added the ability to create and publish CIM Platform documents.</li>
					<li>
						Ensured that the Viewer Form is read-only and added documentation indicating that it is read-only and that users must be a project member to edit or create a document.&nbsp; Previously, the Questionnaire Viewer could be edited but not saved, which was confusing.</li>

						Optimized the Customizer to only load content as-needed. This drastically improved the response time for document types which use large controlled vocabularies (CVs) and eliminated browser time-outs.</li>
					<li>

					<li>
						Fixed the bug that was preventing a property&rsquo;s customized default value from appearing in new documents in the Editor.</li>
					<li>
						Fixed the bug preventing the customization of property categories.&nbsp; Now, when a category is added,&nbsp; that category gets listed as one of the options in the customization of individual properties. This allows properties to be assigned to the new category.&nbsp; When a category is deleted, that category gets removed from the options in the customization of individual properties.</li>
					<li>

					Key features of this release include:</p>

					<li>
						Fixed the bug that prevented further customization after initial document creation. After document creation, changes to the customization refused to save and propagate to the document instances. Now properties can be enabled or disabled at any time even if they were used by previously-created documents.</li>
					<li>
						Fixed the customization of property inheritance to work with the new load-on-demand paradigm.&nbsp; Now if a component&rsquo;s property is inherited, its value will be passed onto all corresponding child properties regardless of whether those child properties reside in forms that have not yet been loaded. &nbsp;</li>
					<li>
						Redesigned the Project Page to be much more intuitive and user-friendly.&nbsp; There is now a clear distinction between creating new documents and editing existing documents.&nbsp; Different portions of the page are also hidden or revealed based on whether the user is a project member, project administrator, or anonymous user.</li>
					<li>
						Refactored the custom selection widget used by the Questionnaire. The former code only worked in Firefox. It now works in Chrome and Safari.</li>
					<li>
						Modified the widget that appears when the &quot;other&quot; property value is selected as an answer to a question. Now it is a text input box that is selectable just via a mouse focus.&nbsp; This makes it easier to delete and replace the default text.</li>
					<li>
						Fixed an error that was incorrectly incrementing document versions multiple times during a save.</li>
					<li>
						Implemented a custom &ldquo;404&rdquo; error page.&nbsp; The new page displays an informative message about the error. Previously, the error resulted in a stack trace understandable only by developers.</li>
					<li>
						Prevented customizations from validating if a user chooses to display all documents under a top-level document, but neglects to provide a name for that document.</li>
					<li>
						Prevented all components within a single Editor instance to be listed separately on the Project Page (versus as a single document set), when a top-level document had not been specified in the customization.</li>

						Fixed an error preventing the XML serialization (export) of properties which use enumerations with multiple enumerated values, and/or properties that use a custom &ldquo;other&rdquo; value.</li>
					<li>
						Ensured the properties of unloaded components are correctly saved.&nbsp; Previously, they could only be saved if they had been changed - something which is impossible for an unloaded property. &nbsp;</li>
					<li>
						Fixed the &ldquo;view&rdquo; button at the bottom of the Customizer. It now correctly loads the Editor.&nbsp; Previously it was using an invalid URL and the Editor could not be found.</li>
					<li>
						Prevented popup dialog boxes from jumping to the bottom of the page when clicked.</li>
					<li>
						Ensured that after logging in from the Project page, a user is redirected back to the Project page. Previously, a user was redirected back to the Questionnaire Landing page and they had to navigate back to their Project page..</li>
					<li>
						Improved the messages (both for successes and failures) that are displayed after saving or publishing a Questionnaire Instance.</li>
					<li>
						Improved the look-and-feel of accordion headers.&nbsp; Previously, hovering over an open accordion header made the header text unreadable.</li>
					<li>

					Key features of this release include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Optimized the Editor to only load content as-needed.&nbsp; This drastically improved response time of the interface and elimintated browser time-outs as large controlled vocabuaries (CVs) loaded.</li>
					<li>
						Restructured the testing framework to use fixtures (a database snapshot) as opposed to manually populating a test database for each test.&nbsp; This simplifies the testing framework and makes release testing cleaner and more efficient.</li>
					<li>
						Improved the help text for customization names to include the set of invalid characters.&nbsp; This prevents unnecessary iterations in the creation of a customization name.</li>
					<li>
						Added new help text concerning the customization of subforms to make that process clearer.</li>
					<li>
						Added a distinct &quot;name&quot; and &quot;version&quot; for CIM versions that are registered with the Questionnaire allowing them to vary independently.&nbsp; Previously, the version was simply included as part of the name.</li>
					<li>
						Alphabetized the list of documents available to edit from the Project Index.&nbsp; This makes it easier to find documents in the pull down menu.</li>
					<li>
						Allowed character fields to expand as needed to contain long text.&nbsp; Many of the CIM properties are classified as character fields.&nbsp; These fields were often too small.&nbsp; Now the fields expand as necessary.</li>
					<li>
						Ensured that renaming a customization propagates that name change to all parts of the system as needed.&nbsp; Previously, only the top-level customization object was changed which resulted in errors when rendering customizations or documents.</li>
					<li>
						Ensured that any notification messages sent from the Questionnaire include the specific domain of the Questionnaire.&nbsp; This allows notifications from the Questionnaire test server and production server to be distinguished from each other.</li>
					<li>
						Prevented arrow widgets from appearing in accordion headers in Firefox.&nbsp; This was a feature that was added by the browser itself which interfered with Questionnaire functionality.</li>
					<li>
						Allowed controlled vocabularies (CVs) to be renamed.&nbsp; Previously, renaming a CV would prevent customizations or documents from being loaded.</li>
					<li>
						Created a graceful failure when trying to register or re-register a CIM version or a CV in the Django Admin Interface if the corresponding file is no longer available.&nbsp; This process is used repeatedly in testing.</li>

					Key features of this release include:</p>

						Added the ability to export ES-DOC compliant CIM Documents. This enables an end-to-end workflow where metadata can be entered in the Questionnaire and viewed and compared in follow-on ES-DOC tools such as the CIM Viewer and CIM Comparator.</li>

						Added a prompt to allow users to request project membership if attempting to access a form from a project to which they don&rsquo;t belong. Previously, project membership could only be requested via a direct email to the Questionnaire developer.</li>
					<li>
						Changed the &ldquo;view&rdquo; button at the bottom of the Customizer. This button now opens the associated Editor in a new tab. This enables users to bounce back and forth between the Customizer and the Editor, which will speed up the process of customization.</li>
					<li>
						Added the ability to reorder properties in the Customizer by dragging and dropping their corresponding accordion header and not their accordion content. Previously, selecting anything in the accordion content triggered the reordering functionality.</li>
					<li>
						Removed questions about CVs from subforms (e.g. Responsible Parties) in the Customizer. Currently, CVs are only used in reference to scientific properties, and subforms do not display scientific properties.</li>
					<li>
						Fixed the &ldquo;view all&rdquo; button in the category customization section of the Customizer so that it correctly resets the individual category widgets. Clicking this button now enables all categories.</li>
					<li>
						Fixed the names of customizations so that they no longer accept spaces.</li>
					<li>
						Improved subform customizations titles. These titles are taken directly from the CIM, which uses camel case strings and underscores. These features have been removed, increasing the readability of the system.</li>
					<li>
						Fixed the error message that appears if users try to create more than one default customization. This message had been confusing.</li>
					<li>
						Added the ability to automatically strip out any non-standard spacing or formatting ingested from the CIM Schema or from a CV.&nbsp; Both of those items contain numerous errors that need to be fixed at the source.&nbsp; Until then, this ability will prevent those errors from entering the Questionnaire.</li>
					<li>
						Improved the category customization section of the Customizer. The color scheme has been made consistent with the rest of the Questionnaire (i.e. blue implies enabled and greyed-out implies disabled).</li>
					<li>
						Fixed long accordion header names so that they are no longer cut off in both the Customizer and the Editor.</li>

						Fixed the behavior of property category widgets.&nbsp; Details about a property category, such as their name or description, can be customized using these widgets.&nbsp; Additionally, the selection and deselection of a category widget now displays or hides properties belonging to that category so it is obvious which category is being customized.</li>
					<li>
						Added a &ldquo;View All&rdquo; button to the Customizer enabling users to see all the properties to be customized in one list.</li>
					<li>
						Changed the Editor page titles to use a project&rsquo;s &ldquo;title&rdquo; rather than its &ldquo;name.&rdquo; The project title is a more user-friendly description that can include spacing.</li>
					<li>
						Added additional documentation to the &ldquo;default customization&rdquo; property in the Customizer since this feature was poorly understood.</li>
					<li>
						Added a &ldquo;view&rdquo; button at the bottom of Customizer, which allows users to navigate between the Customizer and the Editor in order to check what a customization will look like in the Editor.</li>
					<li>
						Created an initial XML export capability. While published CIM documents will appear in the CIM Questionnaire ATOM feed, more work may need to be done to the XML format in order to make them usable by the follow-on ES-DOC tools.</li>
					<li>
						Added document versioning upon publication. Every time a users clicks the &ldquo;publish&rdquo; button in the Editor, the resultant XML will now be given a new version number. More needs to be done to enable versioning when multiple documents (e.g. Grid and ModelComponent) are described within the same Questionnaire, and to ensure that versioning is applied evenly across sub-documents.</li>
					<li>
						Added the ES-DOC support email to all CIM Questionnaire pages (both Customizer and Editor).</li>

				<p>
					Key features of this release include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Completed a major code refactoring that included the creation of a unit testing framework and simplified the underlying class structure. This improved both code robustness and significantly reduced the number of memory leaks that were causing server instability.</li>
					<li>
						Fixed an underlying issue preventing partially completed documents from being saved. This includes saving documents where all of the required fields have not yet been completed. This is an important feature since most documents take more than one session to complete.</li>
					<li>
						Ensured that properties within subforms are correctly rendered as &ldquo;required&rdquo; or &ldquo;optional&rdquo; instead of inheriting that characteristic from their parent form. This ensures that user-specified customizations propagate correctly to the editing form.</li>
					<li>
						Ensured that the Editor saves partially completed documents regardless of whether any properties within that document have been customized to be invisible to the user. Previously, invisible properties still existed behind the scenes, which inhibited the proper saving of the document.</li>
					<li>
						Added project-specific index pages that list the set of CIM documents belonging to a particular project. These pages provide rapid access to links to customize, edit, and view those documents.</li>
					<li>
						Added the ability for property help text to be viewed in-line as text in addition to the current popup dialog box. This makes the help text more visible to the user. This feature can be enabled on a property by property basis.</li>
					<li>
						Improved the error handling of the Customizer. Specifically, when a property has been customized to be rendered as a subform but that new subform has not been customized the Customizer will not validate.</li>
					<li>
						Added the ability to change CIM properties to render in a different type (e.g. character string versus date) than is specified in the CIM standard. This is particularly useful in rendering properties which expect large blocks of text and in rendering dates in a less precise format.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Known issues fixed in this release:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Users are unable to save partially completed documents.&nbsp; (As part of the refactoring, CIM properties are now represented as relationships within a database rather than as built-in Django fields (e.g. &ldquo;CharFields&rdquo;, &ldquo;DateFields,&rdquo; etc.)&nbsp; The Django fields would not validate if empty.)</li>
					<li>
						&ldquo;Required&rdquo; and &ldquo;optional&rdquo; properties within subforms are not rendered consistently correctly.&nbsp; (Fixed the CSS for &ldquo;required&rdquo; or &ldquo;optional&rdquo; items that was being inherited by all child properties.)</li>
					<li>
						Customizing a relationship parameter to use a subform without then customizing those child subforms will cause the editor to crash.&nbsp; (Customizing a child subform now sets a field on the parent form; if that field is missing, validation of the parent customizer form will fail.)</li>
					<li>
						Some manytomany fields in the CIM (for example, model citations) are being incorrectly treated as manytoone fields in the Questionnaire.&nbsp; (This is no longer relevant as the way that the CIM version is described within the CIM Questionnaire has changed. Previously there were specific Django models for each CIM Class. Now generic Django models are used.)</li>
					<li>
						The Editor is unable to save properties that had been customized to not display. This is because those properties were not being included in the POST data upon form submission. (The properties created during the GET now are restricted to those that have been customized to display.)</li>
					<li>
						The Editor is unable to save subforms with required properties. This is because these subforms are always being checked, rather than only being checked when users have modified the subform content. (The same fix for partially-completed documents described above helped fix this issue. In addition, there is new code to explicitly work out if subform content has changed.)</li>

					New known issues:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Users are unable to save partially completed documents.</li>
					<li>
						Required and optional properties within subforms are not rendered consistently correctly.</li>
					<li>
						Customizing a relationship parameter to use a subforms without then customizing those child subforms will cause the editor to crash.</li>
					<li>
						Some <em>manytomany</em> fields in the CIM (for example, model citations) are being incorrectly treated as <em>manytoone</em> fields in the Questionnaire.</li>
					<li>
						The Editor will not render for documents from <a href="/projects/dcmip-2012">DCMIP-2012</a>.&nbsp; They generate an error due to some form components being uninitialized.</li>
					<li>
						When trying to restore a database using a backup from another database, that restoration will fail if the user structure in both databases is not the same.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Known issues carried over:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Memory inefficiencies cause the Customizer and Editor to load extremely slowly when a Controlled Vocabulary (CV) has many subcomponents and/or scientific properties.</li>
					<li>
						Documents that include no CVs are not rendering corretly in the Editor.</li>
					<li>
						Saving a property in the Customizer without an associated category being specified causes an error which prevents the customization from saving.</li>
					<li>
						The Editor is unable to save properties that had been customized to <em>not</em> display.&nbsp; This is because those properties were not being included in the POST data upon form submission.</li>
					<li>
						The Editor is unable to save subforms with required properties.&nbsp; This is because these subforms are <em>always</em> being checked, rather than only being checked when users have modified the subform content.</li>
					<li>
						Adding a CV to a project with existing customizations does not update those customizations.&nbsp; This results the properties from that CV only being customizable in new customizations and not in existing customizations.</li>
