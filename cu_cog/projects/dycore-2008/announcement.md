<p>The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) announces a Summer Colloquium on</p>
<p>Numerical Techniques for Global Atmospheric Models</p>
<p>June 1-13, 2008, NCAR, Boulder, Colorado, U.S.A.</p>
<p>Hosted by the Advanced Study Program (ASP) of the Societal-Environmental Research and Education Laboratory (SERE), Climate and Global Dynamics Division of the Earth &amp; Sun Systems Laboratory (ESSL), and Computational and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) at NCAR. Additional support is provided by NASA.</p>
<p>The colloquium will survey the latest developments in numerical methods for the dynamical cores of Atmospheric General Circulation Models. The course will engage students in the primary options available for global models such as the choice of the computational grids, numerical methods, resolutions, prognostic variables or model equations. Students will participate in lectures and tutorial sessions, but devote a large fraction of time to research projects to be developed in small groups. Each group will be assigned to a specific dynamical core with which they will run idealized test cases. Model-specific tutors will provide expert advise during the hands-on experience. Students will gain in-depth knowledge of the numerical techniques and scientific performance of the dynamical core in question. The goal is to survey the advantages and trade-offs of different computational approaches and grids for climate and weather research.</p>
<p>We invite graduate students from the atmospheric sciences, applied mathematics and other relevant disciplines to apply. The application deadline is March 1, 2008</p>
<p>More information on www.asp.ucar.edu/colloquium/2008 and the Wiki for the colloquium: www.wiki.ucar.edu/display/dycores/Home</p>
<p>We would be pleased if you could forward this announcement to anyone who could be interested in the colloquium.</p>
<p>For further information please send an Email to Peter H. Lauritzen (pel@ucar.edu).</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Peter H. Lauritzen (NCAR), Christiane Jablonowski (University of Michigan), Mark Taylor (Sandia National Laboratories) and Ramachandran D. Nair (NCAR)</p>
