        <p>Regarding the NASA modeling team: Here is the UCAR policy on travel reimbursements{{:}}</p>
<p><tt>10 Federal Employee Travel: In general, Federal agency funds may not be used to reimburse, or pay in-kind, travel by Federal government employees. Each Federal agency, however, has different guidelines for the reimbursement of Federal employee travel. Contact the Travel Office for specific rules for each agency.</tt></p>
<p>From the UCAR Travel Office:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not know of anyway we can pay for a Federal employees travel with money from their own agency.&nbsp; This goes for ANY agency not just NASA. Unfortunately, I can't think of a creative way around this.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it was a different fund source we are under the impression we can support in kind expenses (direct billed) for NASA employees.&nbsp; As far&nbsp; as we know we should not be cutting checks to NASA employees.&nbsp; Sorry I can't be of more help.&nbsp; I'm forwarding to Shelley in case she has anything to add.<br /> Angie <br class="atl-forced-newline" /></p>
<p>From Kathleen:</p>
<p>Therefore, the NASA modeling team from NASA will have to pay their own expenses.</p>
<p>The other modeling teams travel expenses can be paid out of Phils CGD NASA funds</p>
<p>The student participants will be reimbursed for travel from ASP funds</p>
